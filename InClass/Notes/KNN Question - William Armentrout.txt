KNN Question - William Armentrout

origin: x1=0, x2=0, x3=0

a) Distances
obs./distance/color
1. 3		    R
2. 2		    R
3. 3.1622777	R
4. 2.2360680	G
5. 1.4142136	G
6. 1.7320508	R

b) K = 1, Why?
The point is G because it's closest neighbor is Green.

c) K = 3, Why?
The point is R because of its' 3 closest neighbors 1 is Green and 2 are Red.

d) If the Bayes decision boundary in this problem is highly non-linear, then would we expect the best value for K to be large or small?
Why?

The best K value would be smaller, because when the boundary is non-linear you need a more flexible model which is achieved with a smaller K value.
